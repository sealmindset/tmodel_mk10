The following is the epics and stories I crafted for a contractor to follow for documenting an area of the architecture.

Epic - Document the Supply Chain
SK 206 Identify and document all network connected devices
SK 207 Identify and document all supporting infrastructure required to support the plant environment such as the back-office services (i.e., Oracle EBS (OMS), Siebel, Email)
SK 208 Complete a full discovery scan of the environment
SK 209 Identify application and system owners
SK 210 Identify applications that are actively being developed
SK 211 Identify what are the critical components necessary to keep the plant operational
SK 221 Identify and document all Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilized in the Supply Chain environment

(Targeting a specific component)
Epic - Document the Oracle EBS Environment
SK 213 Identify and document the critical applications/modules of the EBS platform
SK 214 Identify and document all external resources to include vendor support that accesses the EBS platform
SK-215 Identify and document all supporting infrastructure
SK 216 Identify the databases dedicated to the EBS platform
SK 217 Provide an overview (i.e., high level, no deep dive) of the level of effort required to restore the EBS platform
SK 218 Identify and document how data is encrypted, to include any encryption keys, maintain in the database, and/or configuration files
SK-219 Identify Privileged Accounts and how they are provisioned and what backend systems perform this action
SK-220 Identify the highest encryption currently available on the EBS platform

Another dimension I want to include in the template is threat modeling done for the entire technology stack. Incorporate the following:

Epic - Produce a complete threat model for the system described by technology stack (SUBJECT). Assuming the system is publicly reachable, runs with default settings, and currently has no safeguards.

Requirements
Provider-aware mitigations
When listing “Mitigation(s)” and “Log & Monitor” items you must use controls that exist inside the SUBJECT’s own ecosystem (cloud-provider services, SaaS options, native OS features, DevSecOps tooling, etc.).
• Example – “AWS S3 → CloudFront” ➜ use S3 bucket policies, CloudFront OAC, WAF, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Security Hub, IAM SCPs, etc.
• If SUBJECT is on-prem, pick broadly available open-source or enterprise tools (e.g., Suricata, Vault, EDR, Nessus).
• If a required control is not available in that ecosystem, recommend a well-known external control (open-source or commercial) and annotate it with “(external)”.

Zero-Trust & Fundamental Controls Coverage
Each set of mitigations must collectively touch the principles below.
You do not have to mention them verbatim; simply make sure the safeguards map back to them:
• Identity Federation & MFA • PAM • Secrets Mgmt • Vuln Mgmt & Patch • Privileged Remote Access Control • Least Privilege • Network Monitoring • Encryption (in-transit, at-rest, mutual TLS, strong ciphers) • Hardening & Baselines • Validation Testing • Backup & Restore • SIEM/SOAR

Output Rules

Format exactly as shown in the template below – nothing extra.

For every “Mitigation(s)” bullet, keep it one concise action line (“Enable AWS WAF with rate-based rule”, “Enforce S3 bucket policy: ‘aws:SecureTransport true’”, etc.).

The Confluence page should follow this TEMPLATE:

## Threat: <Title> ##

**Description:** <Why this is a threat and how it manifests>

**Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
- **Tactic(s):** <MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s)>
- **Technique(s):** <MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)>
- **Procedure(s):** <How an attacker exploits this threat>

**Risk:**
- **Attack Vector:** Network | Adjacent | Local | Physical
- **Attack Complexity:** Low | High
- **Privileges Required:** None | Low | High
- **User Interaction:** None | Required
- **Social trends:** Trending | Not Trending
- **Ease of exploitation:** Low | Moderate | High (real-world | PoC | theoretical)

**Real-World Example:** <Breach or incident illustrating the threat>

**Impact if Exploited:** <Effects on confidentiality, integrity, availability, business>

**Threat Actor:** Cybercriminal | Insider | Nation-state | Hacktivist

**Attack Vector:** <Where the attack starts (API endpoint, token leak, misconfig, etc.)>

**Detection and Response:** <How to detect & respond to this threat>

**Likelihood:** High | Medium | Low

**Dependencies:** <Pre-conditions required for exploitation>

**Mitigation(s):**
- <Provider-specific/config/tech/monitoring one-liner #1>
- <Provider-specific/config/tech/monitoring one-liner #2>
- <Provider-specific/config/tech/monitoring one-liner #3>

**Log & Monitor:**
- <Provider-specific log source / SIEM rule / alerting tactic>
- <Detector or query example>
- <Response automation pointer>

I want to make this into a template to be reusable for any system/technology stack not just Oracle. Also if there are gaps that should also be included such as documenting authentication, authorization, SDLC, logging, monitoring, alerting, available environments (e.g., Dev, Test, QA, Stage, Prod), 3rd party integrations, API type (REST, SOAP, gRPC, etc.), Services the systems provides (e.g., MFT, SMTP, etc.), <provide additional areas that should be included>. 

The goals is to have a template that can be used to document any system/technology stack not just Oracle. Understand the threats and document the mitigation(s) for each threat. The entire technology stack is documented and the threats can be mitigated and with the additional benefit of being able to create a Jira ticket for each mitigation and assign it to the appropriate team member. A DR/BCP plan can leverage the information documented to reconstruct/recreated the system/technology stack.

1  Design highlights
1.1 Kanban‑oriented issue hierarchy
Atlassian recommends keeping Epics → Stories → Sub‑tasks as the deepest hierarchy in a Kanban board; extra layers (Initiatives/Themes) add overhead without improving flow for a single system‑documentation effort.

 Each mitigation is therefore a sub‑task that can move independently across the board.

### 1.2 Bi‑directional Confluence ⇄ Jira linking
Link each Story page in Confluence to its matching Jira issue, then include the Jira “Issue/Filter” macro inside the page for auto‑status roll‑ups.

### 1.3 Threat‑modelling backbone
Every component gets at least one Threat page in the ATT&CK‑aligned template below; provider‑aware mitigations map back to Zero‑Trust pillars (identity, PAM, encryption, SIEM, etc.).

### 1.4 Comprehensive artefact coverage
Stories cover asset discovery, IoT enumeration, SDLC docs, auth/z, logging/monitoring, DR/BCP, third‑party integrations, API styles, and critical‑service definitions—reflecting modern architecture‑documentation checklists.

## 2  Reusable Jira issue tree

## 4  Implementation tips

Kick‑off with an automated discovery scan to populate the ENV‑DISC epic; schedule recurring scans to avoid drift.

Use provider baselines (CIS benchmarks, Azure/Microsoft baselines, AWS Well‑Architected, etc.) as ready‑made mitigations to accelerate SEC‑CTRL tasks.

Prioritise log onboarding from firewalls, endpoints, cloud control planes and IAM systems—these are universally high‑value SIEM sources.

Link each mitigation sub‑task to its corresponding Threat page so risk context is always visible in Jira cards; Confluence auto‑tracks the status via the “Status” macro.

Align DR‑BCP stories with RTO/RPO figures derived from business‑impact analysis to ensure rebuild instructions cover the full application stack, not just databases.
